# SpriteEditor-QT
This is a sprite editor that allows the user to create, edit, save, and export sprite sheets to be used within simple games. The application previews your sprite sheet as an animated object, and also can export the sprite sheet as a .gif or a .pdf. Must have QT installed to build and run.
